Albert,

I was trying to reach you by phone in the weekend....

I put the input file on the web:
http://vlsicad.ucsd.edu/~bliu/nn830.in

The bug comes when running BST1.3 version:
./bst -i nn830.in -B 0

Thanks for your help,
--Bao

I'm at San Jose now and I can be reached by
(408)727-8988 x 135 (W)
(408)615-8380  (H)
