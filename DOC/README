The following two files are examples of the input to the BST/DME program.
1. p1 contains the sink location and per-unit resistance/capacitance.
2. p1.top_B10 contains a topology for the above sinks in p1.
  (Actually, p1.top_B10 contains the resulting topology after running
   "bst -i p1 -B 10"".

  Note that the following two runs should produce the same results
1. "bst -i p1 -B 10 "       
2. "bst -i p1 -B 10 -G p1.top_B10" 
  The first run generate a topology in file  p1.top_B10.
The second run just do the embedding of the same topology in  p1.top_B10.


  Users can create their own sink input file and topology files farily easily
after reading the comments in the above two files.




The following two files are the examples of the output files from BST/DME.
Users can view  them by using the xgraph package, which is
can be obtained from http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~radford/xgraph.html
 
1. p1.xg_B10    
2. p1_area.xg_B10

  To view the resulting bounded-skew tree, simply type 
      "xgraph -tk -P r1.xg_B10"

  to view the corresponding tree of merging regions, simply type 
      "xgraph -tk -P p1_area.xg_B10"
